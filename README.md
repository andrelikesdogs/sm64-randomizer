# Super Mario 64 ROM Randomizer Generator

This is a work in progress project to build an [OoT-Randomizer](https://www.ootrandomizer.com/)-style randomizer for Super Mario 64, that is highly configurable but easy to use.

# Features

- Works on all endianess' (`.z64`, `.n64`, `.v64`) and all regions (America, Europe, China, Japan, Japan Shindou).
- Works on ROMhacks (**Please note:** Romhacks can be vastly different. Please contact us in the discord if you have any trouble.)
- Randomizes Level Entries - Every Level will be a different one
- Randomizes Castle Paintings - To visually match the entrance of the level it now leads to.
  - _New_: Levels without a castle painting will show a painting visually matching the original style, by the talented [Mika](https://not-very-artistic.tumblr.com/)
- Byte alignment for running on real hardware. Default is `8`
- Randomizes Dialog
- Randomizes Music
- Randomizes Mario's Outfit
- Randomizes Coin Colors
- Randomizes Objects in Level
- Randomizes Musical Instruments
- Randomizes Skybox
- Disables Cutscenes
- Disables Level Intros
- ~~Disable Keydoors~~ (Currently disabled)
- ...many more to come


The application is supported on everdrive. To ensure everdrive compatibility, please change the name to a shorter one, as that seems to cause issues. For further help, please visit the Discord Server.


Also auto extends ROM to work with the randomizer. If this fails, extend your ROM manually and use either [sm64extender](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=77343) or [Super Mario 64 ROM Extender](http://qubedstudios.rustedlogic.net/Mario64Tools.htm).

# Web
For extremely simple usage, simply use our existing web generator, found here: https://andrelikesdogs.github.io/sm64-randomizer/

![SM64 Randomizer Generator Web Edition](https://i.imgur.com/78OiLPZ.png)

### Usage
Follow instructions on the website. Upload your original SM64 rom, select the settings and press "Queue for generation" you'll quickly receive your randomized ROM.

# GUI
The randomizer includes a simple GUI for easy setup without any knowledge about the command line. Simply download the latest [release](/releases/latest) and open `SM64 Randomizer GUI`.

### Install
1. Download the [latest release](/releases/latest)
2. Extract **all files** in a folder of your liking
3. Run SM64 Randomizer Generator.exe

### Usage
1. Select an Input ROM
2. Select an Output (will be automatically determined to <rom-name>.out.<file-extension>)
3. Select your settings
- Choose a custom seed to share with friends who use the same tool
- Copy the settings string to copy your current settings to share with friends. Does not include seed.
4. Press "Generate"
5. Run output file on your emulator/console. :tada:

# CLI
For expert users who want to tinker with configurations, settings and test various roms, it's easier to use the program in CLI mode. To do this, run the application with additional arguments, and it will automatically work as a terminal tool. (For server owners: No graphical interface is required, if more than one argument is given.)

### Install
1. Download the [latest release](/releases/latest)
2. Extract **all files** in a folder of your liking
3. Run SM64 Randomizer Generator.exe in your terminal

### Usage
```
python main.py ./Super_Mario_64_(U)_[!].z64 --shuffle-levels --shuffle-mario-color --shuffle-paintings match --seed 123
```

_Note: Works on all versions of the game, as well as **ROM Hacks** (with some tweaking, contact us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/2ZYfhcB) for help)_

Output will be a file with the same name, ending in `.out.z64`. Run this on your emulator/console.

```
  Super Mario 64 Randomizer  (Version: 0.8.0)

usage: main.py [-h] [--no-extend] [--alignment ALIGNMENT] [--out OUT]
               [--version] [--seed SEED]
               [--shuffle-paintings {vanilla,match,replace-unknown,random}]
               [--custom-painting-author {disable,mika}] [--shuffle-skybox]
               [--shuffle-entries] [--shuffle-mario-outfit] [--shuffle-music]
               [--shuffle-objects] [--shuffle-colors] [--shuffle-text]
               [--disable-cutscenes] [--disable-starwarp]
               [--stardoor-requirements {vanilla,random,open}]
               [--keydoor-requirements {vanilla,open}] [--shuffle-instruments]
               rom

positional arguments:
  rom

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --no-extend           disable auto-extend of ROM, which might fail on some
                        systems
  --alignment ALIGNMENT
                        Specify the byte alignment. If you know this value,
                        you have a higher change of successfully randomizing
                        romhacks.
  --out OUT             target of randomized rom
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  --seed SEED           Allows you to play the same version as a friend,
                        simply enter the same seed as them and you will be
                        playing the exact same ROM.
  --shuffle-paintings {vanilla,match,replace-unknown,random}
                        Change the behaviour of how the paintings in the
                        castle are shuffled ("match" - matches randomized
                        levels, i.e. painting = level, "random" -
                        independently randomize paintings, "off" - leave
                        paintings untouched)
  --custom-painting-author {disable,mika}
                        This property allows changing the custom paintings to
                        a different author, if you want to add your own, see
                        the sm64.vanilla.yml
  --shuffle-skybox      Randomizes the sky-texture between different levels.
                        The black skybox is excluded.
  --shuffle-entries     Shuffles the levelentries. When you enter a level, you
                        will end up at a random one.
  --shuffle-mario-outfit
                        Randomizes parts of Marios Outfit.
  --shuffle-music       Randomizes most songs in the game.
  --shuffle-objects     Shuffles Objects in Levels
  --shuffle-colors      Shuffle various colors in the game
  --shuffle-text        Shuffle Dialog text, for signs, npc dialog, level
                        dialog and prompts.
  --disable-cutscenes   Disables some of the games cutscenes. (Peach Intro,
                        Lakitu Intro, Bowser-Text on Entry)
  --disable-starwarp    Disables automatically leaving the level when you
                        collect a star. This way, all stars act like a
                        100-Coin star or a Bowser 8-Reds Star
  --stardoor-requirements {vanilla,random,open}
                        Changes how the doors to levels require different
                        amounts of stars to be collected beforehand. Random
                        means all doors require stars, but the amount will be
                        random. Open simply means all doors are open from the
                        start.
  --keydoor-requirements {vanilla,open}
                        Changes how the locked keydoors in the castle work.
                        Vanilla means you will require the usual keys from the
                        Bowser fights. Open means they're simply open from the
                        start.
  --shuffle-instruments
                        Shuffles instrument sounds around. Many different
                        objects and songs use different instrument sets, as
                        the N64 can't load all at once. This will shuffle them
                        around. Might be wacky.

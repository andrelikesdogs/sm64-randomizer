# This section defines the various levels contained within this ROM
levels:
  # Level definings serve multiple purposes:
  # - Define course-ids to find them in matchings
  # - Define their paintings, this is so they can be shuffled
  # - Define their order, this is to ensure playability after shuffle

  # Define level "keys"
  # - 0x1 Basement Key
  # - 0x2 Upstairs Key
  # - 0x3 DDD Bowser Sub

  - 0x130005B4

# Start object randomization section. Can be deeply nested with groups, sub-group, etc
# This segment will define all randomizable objects, that will be moved around in a level.
# - Groups can be created (without a "match") property to organize multiple different objects together
# - Matchings have a priority, defined by how much it matches an object in a level
#   - for example: a Coin is supposed to not spawn in the air too high. It is matching via it's behaviour id.
#                  however, in a wingcap level coins *can* spawn in the air. So a more specific "match" with
#                  both the behaviour id and a match for level that have been flagged "fly_stage" will have
#                  priority over the previous matching, allowing you overwrite randomization settings in special
#                  circumstances. Randomizations with a "for" property automatically have +1 priority, as they're
#                  generally intended for special levels that should take priority.
